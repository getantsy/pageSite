        <h3>Applying Encryption and Hashing Algorithms for Secure Communications</h3>
        <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 2024</p>
        <p>
            In this lab, I gained hands-on experience with essential encryption and hashing techniques to secure communications. Using Linux-based tools, I generated and verified MD5, SHA1, and 
            SHA256 hashes to ensure data integrity. I also created and managed GnuPG keys, practiced secure key exchanges, and encrypted and decrypted cleartext messages between users. Additionally, 
            I analyzed RSA and ECDSA encryption methods, enhancing my understanding of modern cryptographic standards. This work strengthened my practical skills in file verification, secure messaging,
            and encryption key management, preparing me for real-world cybersecurity applications.

        <h3>Windows Intrusion Event Analysis</h3>
        <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> September 2024</p>
        <p>
            In this lab, I conducted a detailed analysis of network traffic using tools such as Wireshark, NetworkMiner, and SNORT, focusing on identifying potential security threats. By examining 
            captured packets, I uncovered evidence of an ARP spoofing attack and a Man-in-the-Middle compromise involving an IP network camera masquerading as the legitimate device on the network. 
            The analysis identified suspicious communications, protocol behaviors, and discrepancies that pointed to malicious activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lab demonstrated my ability to interpret packet data, assess protocol hierarchies, and utilize security tools to detect and analyze network threats. My findings highlighted the 
            importance of implementing robust security measures to mitigate the risks of similar attacks, including device resets, firmware updates, and stronger network access controls.

        <h3>Malware Event Investigation and Recovery</h3>
        <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> October 2024</p>
        <p>
            This report details a forensic analysis of a compromised Windows XP system, conducted within the SimSpace Cyber Range environment. The investigation focused on identifying the intrusion
            vector and tracing attacker activities using a combination of Kali Linux and Windows FLARE VM tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key findings include the identification of multiple open ports (21, 25, 80, 6666/6667) with several vulnerabilities exploited for unauthorized access. Notably, Poisonivy.exe, a well-known 
            remote access trojan (RAT), was detected alongside backdoors such as Netcat and VNC. Logs from FTP, web services, and system events revealed patterns of unauthorized access and data 
            manipulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This analysis employed Nmap, Metasploit, and other forensic tools to map the attacker's steps, gather critical evidence, and assess the overall system compromise. The case study emphasizes 
            the importance of comprehensive log analysis and the risks associated with open ports and unpatched services in a networked environment.

      <a class="pdf-link" href="files/Memory Dump Investigation.pdf" target="_blank">
        <h3>Memory Dump Investigation</h3>
        <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 2024</p>
        <p>
            In this lab, I used Volatility to investigate a Windows XP memory dump for signs of compromise. Initial analysis identified normal system processes but also revealed clear indicators of 
            malicious activity, including Hacker Defender (rootkit), Cryptcat (covert communications), Beware IRCD, IROFFER (botnet-related), Poison Ivy (remote access trojan), and unauthorized VNC 
            remote access. Hidden processes were detected through cross-view analysis. Attempts to extract account data were unsuccessful due to file corruption. DLL analysis confirmed suspicious 
            behaviors linked to these threats, indicating the system was compromised, actively communicating externally, and likely part of a botnet.

      <a class="pdf-link" href="files/Ansible.pdf" target="_blank">
        <h3>Ansible</h3>
        <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 2024</p>
        <p>
            In this lab, I used Ansible to automate IT infrastructure management. I created and executed YAML-based playbooks, utilizing the ansible-navigator interface to streamline tasks like 
            system configuration and application deployment. I configured execution environments to improve playbook execution and customized settings for easier task inspection. Through this hands-on 
            experience, I gained a solid understanding of how Ansible simplifies automation and enhances consistency across environments, making it a powerful tool for IT operations.

      <a class="pdf-link" href="files/Cyber Attack Packet Analysis.pdf" target="_blank">
        <h3>Cyber Attack Packet Analysis</h3>
        <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> December 2024</p>
        <p>
            This report investigates a potential security breach using forensic artifacts such as packet captures (PCAP), application logs, and security logs. The analysis, utilizing tools like 
            Wireshark and NetworkMiner, reveals suspicious network traffic between two devices (192.168.134.129 and 192.168.134.132), with multiple open ports and abnormal SMB traffic patterns. The 
            devices exhibit failed SMB logon attempts, encryption for evading detection, and unusual data flow, suggesting a compromise. Signs of data exfiltration, including manipulated TCP flow 
            control and ARP spoofing, further indicate unauthorized access. Given these findings, it is likely that the EternalBlue exploit was used as the attack vector. Overall, the evidence 
            confirms a significant security breach, with potential data theft occurring.
